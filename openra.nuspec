    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>A Libre/Free Real Time Strategy game engine supporting early Westwood classics.</summary>
    <description>
    
    OpenRA is an open-source reimplementation of Westwood's Command and Conquer: Red Alert game engine, updated to use the hardware acceleration of modern video cards using OpenGL and cross-platform positional sound built upon OpenAL. It runs on Windows, Linux and macOS. Feel free to improve upon OpenRA. The development process is public and open to everyone. We are happy to include your patches after a code review.
